# Time_Tracking_Dashboard_Main

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge from front-end mentor. It is a site to practice front end skills for front end mentors.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By Completing this project I have learned a hard lession. Never keep the media query for the last. It will be a big pain in the end.

-- Use of Flexbox wrap(CSS3)
flex-wrap: wrap; to make the boxes assemble according to devices
-- Use of multiple ternery operators(JS)
data_Id=='2'?
data[5].timeframes.weekly.current: data_Id=='3'?
data[5].timeframes.monthly.current: data[5].timeframes.daily.current

### Continued development

It seems that I am facing trouble with fetch API and JSON so I am looking forward with completing challenges like these

## The challenge

My Challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I have completed this project with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & JSON.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behaviour

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".
